# Online Cryptography Course Ad Analysis

## Business Understanding

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and wants to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. Previously, she ran ads to promote a related course on the same blog and collected data. She now seeks your expertise as a Data Science Consultant to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

### Objectives
To work on this problem, the following tasks need to be completed:

1. **Define the problem and success metrics**: Establish the key question to answer, determine the criteria for success, and understand the context of the data.
2. **Assess data quality and pre-process the dataset**: Identify and handle outliers, anomalies, and missing values to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
3. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.
4. **Build predictive models**: Use machine learning techniques to classify users based on their likelihood to click on ads.
5. **Provide actionable recommendations**: Translate findings into business strategies that can improve ad targeting and effectiveness.

## Data Insights and Observations

The dataset comprises user demographic details, browsing behavior, and ad engagement metrics. From the analysis, the following key observations emerged:

- **Spending Habits**: People most likely to click on adverts are those who spend **less than Ksh 169.23**, while only about half of those spending **around 63 minutes** on the site engage with ads.
- **Non-Engaging Users**: Users who spent **more than Ksh 169.23** and **689 minutes** on the site did not click on any adverts. This suggests a potential disconnect between content and ad relevance for high-spending users.
- **Age Distribution**: The majority of site visitors are aged **between 30 and 60**, but ad engagement is primarily driven by users **between 20 and 40**.
- **Gender Demographics**: The site attracts more **female users**, who also exhibit higher engagement with advertisements.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Optimize Ads for Female Users**: Since the majority of visitors and ad clickers are female, ad visuals and messaging should be tailored to appeal to this demographic. This could involve using **pink color palettes, relatable imagery, and content aligned with their interests**.
2. **Enhance Engagement for Younger Users**: The age group most likely to click on ads is between **20 and 40**. Ads should incorporate **animations, interactive elements, and visually engaging graphics** to maintain their attention.
3. **Target High-Income Users Effectively**: Users who spend more time on the site and have higher purchasing power do not engage with the ads. The ad content should be refined to better align with their interests, such as offering **exclusive content, discounts, or additional value propositions**.
4. **Refine Ad Placement and Timing**: Since users with shorter site visits tend to engage more, placing ads strategically during the first few minutes of browsing could improve click-through rates.
5. **A/B Testing for Improved Targeting**: Experiment with different ad formats, messaging styles, and content variations to determine what resonates best with different user segments.
